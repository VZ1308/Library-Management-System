# Library-Management-System
Library Management System Overview This project is a Library Management System that helps libraries manage their operations, such as tracking books, users, employees, and borrowing transactions. It provides both command-line and (optional) graphical user interface (GUI) modes to allow users to interact with the system in different ways.
